               I worked on a team of 3 undergraduates lead by PhD student Alireza
               Dayerizadeh in building a wirelessly powered drone. We worked to
               recreate this design from a paper by <a id="pop4" href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8469090">J. M. Arteaga, et. al.</a> Over the
               course of this year we made progress on board design and designing the
               necessary coils, but were cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic and were
               unable to debug some of the problems with our first two iterations.

               The first thing we did was build, in LTspice, the induction charging circuit in
               <a id="pop5" href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8469090">J. M. Arteaga, et. al.</a>
               while changing the measurements of components to match ones we were
               able to source as well as a Gallium Nitride GaN FET.
               In doing this, and simulating a 13.65MHz input signal we were able to
               verify that the transmitting circuit, coupled inductive coils, and
               receiving circuit all operated as expected.

               With this verified, we were comfortable moving onto designed and
               building these circuits for live testing. I focused on designing
               the EF Class Inverter that would power the inductive coils on the
               ground. While I knew the circuit, and the driver circuit was already
               built, I had to design the inverter in way that would give us extra
               space to mount more components for fine tuning, as well as make sure
               that the circuit was safe and efficient in high frequency
               applications.

               These operated for the most part as expected, however the Inverter driver
               was prone to overheating. We made as many changes as we could, however
               could not fix this before the COVID-19 pandemic occurred closing the lab.
               We believe this was due to less copper layers and weight being used in our
               board  to reduce cost than the other boards we modeled this off of.
