               I am a maker. I like to build things and take apart things I have
               so that I can understand them. One thing I did not understand, and
               was not willing to take apart, was my VR headset works. This lead
               me to looking into DIY Mixed Reality (MR) Head Mounted Displays (HMD). While
               doing this and talking about it with my mentors, <a id="pop9" href="https://logicgrip.com/director/index.html">Dr. Derek Ham</a> and
               <a id="pop10" href="http://payodpanda.com/">Payod Panda</a>  in the <a id ="pop8" href ="https://www.relativty.com/">
               Mixed Reality Lab at NC State</a>, I had a new line
               of questions not only about VR but also about other maker experinces
               and learning.

               I started to ask myself about the impact of DIY on learning,
               which was integral to me. I wondered about VR in education, as well
               as why educational DIY kits often did not create projects that
               were comperable to technology we use regularly like smart devices.
               This all lead me to begin pursuing a project about all these questions.

               I wanted to create a VR headset kit for DIY making in an educational
               setting. To begin this, I looked back at the DIY HMDs that I started
               this line of questioning with, specifically the <a id ="pop7" href="https://www.relativty.com/">
               Realativty</a> HMD. With this as a foundation, I worked on adapting the HMD
               to use an Arduino and other easily sourced parts, as well as adding
               passthrough Augmented Reality.

               Building this headset involved a few technical desings. Firstly,
               I had to build a stereoscopic display to allow for depth perception
               that MR is know for. This used two fresnel lenses and a LCD that
               is often used for DIY projects. Secondly, we needed some motion tracking.
               This was enebaled with an Arduino Due and and MPU 6050 IMU. The MPU
               6050 sends accelerometer and gyroscope data to the Arduino which
               is configured as a Human Interface Device (HID) that allowed low latency
               communication of the IMU datat to the computer. Finally, I added a
               stereoscopic camera to allow us to pull this into a Unity camera rig
               that created a Passthrough Augmented Reality environment. All of
               this was then combined in a 3D printed body that I designed for these
               components.

               I am really proud of this project. I am in the process of
               conducting some user studies to see if this impacts perception and
               understanding of mixed reality, interest in Science, Technology, Engineering,
               Art, and Math, and the impact of making something that people often
               see or use in modern technology.
